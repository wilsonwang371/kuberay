KubeRay is an open source toolkit to run Ray applications on Kubernetes.

KubeRay provides several tools to improve running and managing Ray's experience on Kubernetes.

- Ray Operator
- Backend services to create/delete cluster resources
- Kubectl plugin/CLI to operate CRD objects
- Data Scientist centric workspace for fast prototyping (incubating)
- Native Job and Serving integration with Clusters (incubating)
- Kubernetes event dumper for ray clusters/pod/services (future work)
- Operator Integration with Kubernetes node problem detector (future work)

## Documentation

You can view detailed documentation and guides at [https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/)

## Quick Start

### Use Yaml

#### Nightly version

```
kubectl create -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/cluster-scope-resources"
kubectl apply -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/base"
```

#### Stable version

```
kubectl create -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/cluster-scope-resources?ref=v0.2.0"
kubectl apply -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/base?ref=v0.2.0"
```

#### Single Namespace version

It is possible that the user can only access one single namespace while deploying KubeRay. To deploy KubeRay in a single namespace, the user
can use following commands.

```

export KUBERAY_NAMESPACE=<my-awesome-namespace>
# executed by cluster admin
kustomize build "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/overlays/single-namespace-resources" | envsubst | kubectl create -f -
# executed by user
kustomize build "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/manifests/overlays/single-namespace" | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -

```

### Use helm chart

A helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. It can help users to deploy ray-operator and ray clusters conveniently.
Please read [kuberay-operator](helm-chart/kuberay-operator/README.md) to deploy an operator and [ray-cluster](helm-chart/ray-cluster/README.md) to deploy a custom cluster.

### Monitor

We have add a parameter `--metrics-expose-port=8080` to open the port and expose metrics both for the ray cluster and our control plane. We also leverage the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) to start the whole monitoring system.

You can quickly deploy one by the following on your own kubernetes cluster by using the scripts in install:
```shell
./install/prometheus/install.sh
```
It will set up the prometheus stack and deploy the related service monitor in `config/prometheus`

Then you can also use the json in `config/grafana` to generate the dashboards.
